						<h3>In a nutshell</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll say it upfront because it's trendy: I'm a productive <strong>Minimalist</strong>.  Yeah, that's right, I'm a simple 28 y/o man that does not need much to be happy.  I'm careful about what I buy and who gets to be part of my world.Don't get me wrong, I have many dreams and there are plenty of things I'd like to achieve in my life.  This, because I'm curious about how the world works and I care about the future of mankind.  I'm always glad to share my humble experiences with anyone if they think it can help them become a better person.  I got my own inspiration from people like Jacob Collier, Peter Joseph, Jacque Freso to name a few. </p>

								<h3>A day in my life</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every morning I wake up around 7h30 to workout for about 20-30 mins.  I can go for a run or follow an home routine on youtube (the least I can do is go for a walk).  Then I'll shower, get a bowl of oatmeal and read while having breakfest.   When I'm done eating, I usually feel energized and ready to tackle the day.  Whether I am "working for a living" or on my own projects, I can focus for a good amount of time on the same task.  I take short breaks to eat apples or to make a series of abs or push ups.  Most of the time, it's only at lunch that I'll try to catch up with my social life, organizing the next bike trip or roundnet session of the evening/weekend.  Around 17p.m., I heat up the prepped meals that I cooked on sunday.  At this point, I should feel like I've had a productive day and would try to wrap things up by planning the next.</p>

								<h3>And about the future</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm looking forward to become a skilled web/app developer.  What drives me the most is the possibility to contribute to a project I have with my friends. <a href="https://asimpac.com/"><strong>ASIMPAC</strong></a> is our attemp to prove that we can build a more sustainable world by applying sciences and technologies to social concerns.</p>
